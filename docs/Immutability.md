Most objects in Mobius are required to be immutable. Immutability imposes a constraint on what your objects can do, therefore making them easier to reason about. The Mobius framework is in fact based on the principle that [Model](Model), [Event](Event), and [Effect](Effect) objects are immutable – it wouldn’t be possible to have Mobius without this constraint.

For an object to be immutable, it is not enough to make all member fields final. Any object referred to must also be immutable. If any field references a mutable object, then your object is not immutable (the exception being if the field isn’t important for behaviour; an example is `java.util.String` instances that are immutable even though they cache the hash code in a mutable field). In particular be careful with arrays - they might be marked as `final`, but that only makes the reference to the array final, not the values inside the array.

It might be tempting sometimes to use e.g. a plain `List` instead of an `ImmutableList`, and you might in fact get away with it, especially if it’s only your own code that touches the data. But it’s strongly advised to avoid this, as it is a potential source of errors, and breaking the immutability contract means you no longer get any guarantees from the framework. While it might not seem like a big issue, it might have unintended consequences or cause problems later on.
